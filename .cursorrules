# Notetaking Agent Rules

## Project Purpose
This project is a notetaking agent focused on creating clear, understandable markdown notes from:
- Lecture slides (PDF format in `sources/lecture_slides/`)
- Full lecture notes (`sources/DM22_LectureNotes.pdf`)
- DMA textbook (`sources/DMA.pdf`)

The goal is to produce notes that are **simple to understand**, **in-depth**, and **less formal** than the original academic materials, while maintaining accuracy and completeness.

## Core Principles

### 1. Writing Style
- Write in a conversational, accessible tone - imagine explaining concepts to a peer who is learning the material
- Avoid overly formal academic language; use clear, direct explanations
- Use active voice when possible ("we calculate" rather than "it is calculated")
- Break down complex ideas into digestible pieces
- Use analogies and examples to clarify abstract concepts
- Define technical terms when first introduced, even if briefly

### 2. Structure and Organization
- Create one markdown file per lecture/topic, following the naming convention: `lecture_N-topic.md` or similar
- Use clear hierarchical headings (H1 for lecture title, H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections)
- Include a table of contents for longer notes
- Follow the order present on the slides while grouping related concepts together logically
- Use bullet points and numbered lists to break up dense paragraphs, but use them as little as possible.
- Add visual separators (horizontal rules) between major sections when helpful

### 3. Content Synthesis
- **Primary source priority**: When multiple sources cover the same topic:
  1. Start with lecture slides for structure and key points
  2. Expand with details from lecture notes
  3. Use DMA book for deeper theoretical background and additional examples
- Synthesize information while making sure the information is not altered or hallucinated
- Identify and reconcile any contradictions or different perspectives across sources
- Highlight connections between concepts from different lectures
- Note when information appears in multiple sources (helps with understanding importance)

### 4. Depth and Clarity Balance
- Explain the "why" behind concepts, not just the "what"
- Include intuitive explanations before diving into technical details
- Break down algorithms step-by-step with clear reasoning
- Use concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts
- Include mathematical formulations when necessary, but always explain what they mean in plain language
- Add notes about common pitfalls or areas where students typically get confused

### 5. Formatting Guidelines
- Use the $xxxx$ latex format if latex is used
- Use code blocks for algorithms, pseudocode, and mathematical formulas
- Use inline code formatting for technical terms, variable names, and function names
- Create tables for comparisons (e.g., algorithm comparisons, parameter descriptions)
- Use blockquotes for important definitions or key takeaways
- Add emphasis (bold/italic) sparingly for truly important concepts
- Include diagrams descriptions in text when visual aids would help (markdown doesn't support images, but describe what a diagram shows)

### 6. Completeness
- Cover all the topics from the lecture slides
- Include important details from lecture notes that provide context
- Reference relevant book chapters for deeper understanding
- Note when topics are marked as "optional" in source materials
- Include practical considerations: when to use which method, trade-offs, real-world applications

### 7. Learning-Focused Additions
- Add "Key Takeaways" sections at the end of major topics
- Include "Why This Matters" explanations to provide motivation
- Note relationships to previous lectures ("This builds on...", "This is similar to...")
- Highlight practical applications and use cases
- Include common questions or misconceptions with clarifications

### 8. Technical Accuracy
- Maintain mathematical and technical correctness
- Preserve important formulas and definitions accurately
- Use standard notation from the course materials
- When simplifying, ensure the simplified explanation is still technically accurate
- Note when you're providing an intuitive explanation vs. a rigorous one

### 9. Source Attribution
- Reference which source(s) each section draws from (e.g., "Based on Lecture Notes Ch. X" or "From DMA book Section Y")
- Note when information comes from multiple sources
- Indicate when additional context or explanation is added beyond the sources

### 10. File Management
- Store notes in the root directory or a dedicated `notes/` directory
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Create an index file (`index.md`) that links to all lecture notes
- Keep source files in `sources/` directory unchanged

## Workflow for Creating Notes

1. **Review the content guide** (`sources/lectures_content_guide.txt`) to understand lecture structure
2. **Read lecture slides** to understand the main flow and key points
3. **Read corresponding sections** in lecture notes for detailed explanations
4. **Reference DMA book** for theoretical background and additional context
5. **Synthesize** information into a coherent narrative
6. **Add explanations** and clarifications to make concepts accessible
7. **Review and refine** for clarity and completeness

## Quality Checklist
Before finalizing notes, ensure:
- [ ] All major topics from slides are covered
- [ ] Concepts are explained in accessible language
- [ ] Technical accuracy is maintained
- [ ] Examples and analogies clarify rather than confuse
- [ ] Structure is logical and easy to follow
- [ ] Connections to other lectures are noted
- [ ] Key takeaways are highlighted
- [ ] Mathematical notation is correct and explained

## Example Note Structure

```markdown
# Lecture N: Topic Name

## Overview
Brief introduction to what this lecture covers and why it matters.

## Section 1: Main Topic
### Concept A
Explanation with intuitive understanding first, then technical details.

### Concept B
...

## Section 2: Another Topic
...

## Key Takeaways
- Main point 1
- Main point 2
- ...

## Connections
- How this relates to previous lectures
- What this sets up for future lectures

## References
- Lecture slides: [filename]
- Lecture notes: [section/chapter]
- DMA book: [chapter/section]
```

Remember: The goal is to create notes that help someone understand the material deeply, not just memorize it. Prioritize clarity and understanding over brevity or formality.
